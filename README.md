These measures include, where feasible, the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data both in transit and at rest. Our security practices are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your personal information.

### Withdrawal of consent

If you have given your consent to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR, you can withdraw this consent at any time. The lawfulness of the processing of the personal data until the withdrawal is not affected by the withdrawal.

### Transfer of data

We only transfer or disclose your personal data to third parties when required by applicable law, regulation, or legal process, or when it is necessary for the performance or provision of our services to you. In all cases, we ensure that any transfer of your personal data complies with relevant data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) where applicable. Third-party data processors process personal data only as necessary to deliver the agreed-upon services, in accordance with our instructions and applicable data protection agreements. We do not sell your personal data to third parties. If we intend to use your personal data for purposes that require your consent under applicable law, we will obtain your explicit consent beforehand.

### Rights of Data Subjects

#### Right of Access

You have the right to request at any time information about the personal data we store about you and to receive a copy of that information. Furthermore, you have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether the personal data in question is being processed.

#### Right to Rectification

Should your data be inaccurate or incomplete, we will rectify it upon request.

#### Right to Data Portability

If we process your personal data in an automated way based on your consent or based on a corresponding agreement, you have the right to request a copy of your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, which can be sent to you or another party.

### Data Transfer to the United States of America and the Data Privacy Framework

To ensure the protection of your personal data when it is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we rely on recognized legal mechanisms in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision under Article 45(1) GDPR for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF). This means that personal data can be lawfully transferred from the EEA to organizations in the United States that participate in the DPF, as these organizations are considered to provide an adequate level of data protection equivalent to that of the EU.

#### What does this mean for you?

- When we use US-based service providers to process your personal data, we ensure that such providers are certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. Certification requires these organizations to adhere to strict data protection principles and is subject to oversight and enforcement by US authorities.
- The adequacy decision provides a valid legal basis for these data transfers, ensuring your rights and protections under the GDPR are maintained.
- You can verify whether a US service provider is currently certified under the Data Privacy Framework by visiting the official [Data Privacy Framework website](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list).

If we engage a US service provider that is not certified under the Data Privacy Framework, we will clearly inform you in this privacy notice and specify the alternative legal safeguards in place for such transfers (for example, Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission).

Regardless of the transfer mechanism, you retain all rights provided under the GDPR, including the right to access, rectify, erase, or restrict the processing of your personal data, as well as the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

For more details about the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the adequacy decision, you can visit the [European Commission's website](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en).

### Standard Contractual Clauses

In order to enable data transfer to countries without an adequacy decision, the EU Commission has drawn up standard contracts (standard contractual clauses). These standard contractual clauses require contractual partners to adhere to a level of data protection comparable to that in the EU. These contractual texts are made available on the **[European Commission's website](https://commission.europa.eu/publications/publications-standard-contractual-clauses-sccs_de)**. Standard contractual clauses are abbreviated to "SCC".
